# tweaker

**tweaker** is a Python toolkit for transforming messy, semi-structured text into clean, structured data. Itâ€™s built to power the **Transform** stage of an ETL pipeline â€” not fetching, not storing â€” just turning input into something usable.

`tweaker` helps you clean up things like currency amounts, dates, contact info, region names, and typed values. Itâ€™s a utility belt for wrangling messy input and transforming it into structured output.
